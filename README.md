## 📱 Product Concept
SmartBuild addresses the chaotic nature of the construction industry by unifying three core pillars into one dashboard: **Project Management**, **Supply Chain**, and **Human Resources**.

## 🛑 The Problem
The current construction landscape in developing markets suffers from:
* **📉 Efficiency Gaps:** 35% of project timelines are delayed due to poor labor allocation.
* **💸 Material Wastage:** Theft and mismanagement of inventory (Cement, Steel) lead to 15-20% cost overruns.
* **📵 Communication Silos:** Disconnect between on-site foremen and off-site managers.

## 💡 The SmartBuild Solution
We propose a 3-tier solution to digitize the site:

| Module | Functionality | Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🏗️ Site Command Center** | Real-time Gantt charts & daily logs | Keeps projects on schedule. |
| **🧱 Inventory IoT** | Smart sensor integration for stock levels | Prevents theft & auto-reorders material. |
| **👷 Labor Marketplace** | Uber-style hiring for skilled labor | Instant access to verified masons/electricians. |
